    "#### There are two questions to answer here in this mini-project:\n",
    "##### 1. Can you get 6-fold modulations in aggregate signal by making randomly directed traversals across a square environment if the underlying neural representation of that space is 6-fold symmetric, just by stacking layers of representations of different scales (according to the known scale difference between them) and with some relative phases between each grid layer.\n",
    "##### 2. How might a 2D/4-fold symmetric structure emerge from a 6-fold grid structure? If 6-fold grid structure does exist, how do people say that they factorised representation into 2 axes? The issue with grid cell patterns (6 fold) is that they dont factorise into 2 dimensions. So how does that transformation/computation take place? This is relevant theory both for the Constantinescu paper and the odor paper."
