# gridSimulations
This is a simulated mini-project which attempts to understand whether aggregate N-fold grid codes can give rise to M-fold grid codes, where N != M, and X={N,M}={4,6}.
This project seeks to understand how a 6-fold-symmetric grid code observed in primate entorhinal cortex (hypothesized as a neural substrate of abstract conceptual thought), can give rise to 4-fold-symmetric reasoning i.e. a factorisable representation.
